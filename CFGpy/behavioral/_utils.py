        In the legacy "Aviv" branch code, we were calling this current method recursively, and by that

        Here, we call the STANDARD segment_explore_exploit, which gives us a better upper-bound on the pace threshold,

            If we use the Legacy method, we might calibrate based on segments where the player was actually thinking for a long time (staring),
             just because their hand moved fast. This could pollute the "Pace" baseline with "Thinking" data.
    
            Using the Standard function ensures we only calibrate using segments where the player was fast both physically and mentally.
