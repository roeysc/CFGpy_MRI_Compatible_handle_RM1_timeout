# `CFGpy.behavioral` - Behavioral Data Pipline

After running a behavioral Creative Foraging Game experiment, the data is processed using this package.
The pipeline ends in a CSV file where each row represents a participant that met our filtering criteria and each column is one
of the standard [Creative Foraging Game measures](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/nmhuytz6).

## Basic Usage

As of v1.0.0, this package can only retrieve raw data from RedMetrics1, and see
issue https://github.com/ComDePri/CFGpy/issues/26.

As of v2.0.0, this package can be used to retrieve data from RedMetrics2. 

### Command line

The Pipeline can be run from the terminal as follows:

```
run_pipeline --game-name <game-name> --game-id <game_id> --game-version-ids <game_version_id_1> <game_version_id_2> <...> --config-path <config_file_path> -o <output_filename> --rm1
```

`output_filename` and `config_file_path` are optional. 
Either `game_name`, `game_id` or as many `game_version_ids` (if you are using RedMetrics1) as you want must be provided - but only one of them. Alternatively, if one of them is present in the configuration file, then none of them may be provided.
The flag `--rm1` must be present if you are using RedMetrics1 and not if you are using RedMetrics2.

If you are using RedMetrics2, you can set the following environment variables to avoid being prompted for you email and password to your RedMetrics2 account every time:
RM2_EMAIL
RM2_PASSWORD

To set an environment variable in a linux terminal, you can use the following command:
```
export MY_VAR='some_value'
```
Note: for passwords, it is better to use single inverted commas because the terminal has a hard time with special characters. 

### Python Script

```python
from CFGpy.behavioral import Pipeline

Pipeline(game_name=game_name, game_id=game_id, output_filename=output_filename, game_version_ids=game_version_ids is_rm1=is_rm1, config=config).run_pipeline()
```
`output_filename` and `config` are optional parameters.
Either `game_name`, `game_id` or as many `game_version_ids` as you want (if you are using RedMetrics1) must be provided - but only one of them. Alternatively, if one of them is present in the configuration file, then none of them may be provided.

The game name or id(s) can also be passed as part of a configuration object:

Game name:
```python
from CFGpy.behavioral import Configuration, Pipeline

config = Configuration.default()
config.GAME_NAME = game_name
Pipeline(config=config, output_filename=output_filename).run_pipeline()
```

Game id:
```python
from CFGpy.behavioral import Configuration, Pipeline

config = Configuration.default()
config.GAME_ID = game_id
Pipeline(config=config, output_filename=output_filename).run_pipeline()
```

Game version ids (for RedMetrics1 only):

```python
from CFGpy.behavioral import Configuration, Pipeline

config = Configuration.default(is_rm1=True)
config.GAME_VERSION_IDS = game_version_ids
Pipeline(config=config, output_filename=output_filename).run_pipeline()
```

For RedMetrics1, the parameter `is_rm2` must be set to False for Configuration.default(is_rm2=False) otherwise, the configuration with default to RedMetrics2.

In addition, if you are using RedMetrics1 then the following environment variables must be set:
DB_USER
DB_PASSWORD
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
DB_NAME
where the values for these variables can be accessed on slab.

If you are using RedMetrics2, you can set the following environment variables to avoid being prompted for you email and password to your RedMetrics2 account every time:
RM2_EMAIL
RM2_PASSWORD

You can set the environment variables in the terminal or you can use an env file and load it using the python-dotenv library. 

> 📝 When a pipeline finishes, it outputs its configuration to enable full reproducibility. 
> The outputted configuration will always include the game name, id or version ids (even if the inputted configuration did not), and can be loaded into python.
> using `config = Configuration.from_yaml(config_filename)`

## Modules and Logic

Below is an overview of the different modules composing the pipeline and their functions.

> 📝 To learn more about the different types of data mentioned here,
> see [CFG data types and structure](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/b90dhs98)

### DataRetriever

Retrieves raw data from the RedMetrics1/RedMetrics2 server.

### Parser

This module is responsible for turning raw data into parsed data. It's an objective translator — converts the data's structure
for easier processing downstream, without changing its contents.

The exception to the rule is that Parser removes games that did not start (e.g., no game data, only tutorial data). We call this
a "hard" filter, as it excludes data that cannot be parsed.

As a result, if a player accessed the game but did not start it, or for some reason played the entire thing in the tutorial
stage, they will not be present in the parsed dataset.

After the hard filter is applied, the remaining data is parsed.

### Post-Parser

This module prepares parsed data for feature extraction. Namely:

1. Converting shape IDs from graphic representations to integers.
2. Throws an exception if the data contains "illegal" shapes, meaning shapes that are not supposed to be playable in the game (
   e.g., not all squares are connected).

   > ⚠️ This error indicates a bug in the game software or in the analysis pipeline, so processing cannot continue before it is
   investigated and resolved

   > 📝 Processing can't continue with illegal shapes because it relies on pre-calculated values for all possible shapes and
   transitions between them

3. _In future versions (see https://github.com/ComDePri/CFGpy/issues/2, https://github.com/ComDePri/CFGpy/pull/17):_ Deleting "
   empty" moves: moves that have the same shape as the previous move.

   > 📝 An empty move occurs when a player chooses a block and releases it in the same position where it started. This can happen
   for example if they regretted the move while making it, or as a result of the GUI supporting the release of a block far from
   the shape, by placing it at the nearest legal position (some players have reported using this to get "random" block
   placements).
   >
   > It follows that empty moves may convey meaningful information about the way the game was played (that's why they're not
   eliminated at the Parser level). Maybe in the future handling empty moves will change to support novel features of the
   creative process (
   see [here](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/cfg-open-issues-v8w6zxv9#hc7c6-transitions-between-game-states-are-not-unique)).

4. Segmenting each game to exploration and exploitation phases.

### Feature Extractor

> 📝 For details on the distinction between absolute and relative features, see
> the [Terminology](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/creative-foraging-game-measures-nmhuytz6#hut2h-terminology) section
> in [Creative Foraging Game measures](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/nmhuytz6)

This module produces the end result CSV:

1. Calculates all absolute measures.
2. Drops non-first games for each player.

   > ⚠️ Players with prior CFG experience play the game differently. This stage is here to ensure we only keep the first game
   for each player ID in the sample. If some players are experienced but have unique IDs, those should be flagged for manual
   exclusion in the `Configuration` object passed to `FeatureExtractor`

3. Calculates all [vanilla](https://comdepri.slab.com/posts/e6tzqtk1)-relative features.
4. Applies "soft" filters, i.e., filters that can be chosen and configured by the person analyzing the data, to match their
   preferences and the studied population:
    1. Applies absolute filters, i.e., those that exclude participants based on their absolute measures, such as game duration.
    1. Applies sample-relative filters, e.g., outlier rejection.
5. Calculates all sample-relative measures.

## Pipeline Customization

### Custom modules

To use different classes for any of the modules, create a new class extending pipeline, and override one its private methods (
whose names begin with an underscore).

The public methods contain core logic that should not be overriden, e.g., exception management.

For example:

```python
class MyPipline(Pipeline):
    def _parse():
# use customized parser here
```

### Custom logic

Say you have a use case that requires customizing the pipeline in a way that cannot be encapsulated in a customized module. For
example: you have a single sample saved in several different RedMetrics games. To get accurate relative features, you need the
sample united before it's passed onto feature extraction.

Generally, the intention of this package is to be operated with the `Pipeline` API, with personal modification possible through
configuration files and class inheritance, as outlined above.

But for some use cases, the flexibility of using each module directly might be required.

For the example above, a solution may look something like this:

```python
parsed_united = []
for url in urls:
    raw_data = DataRetriever(url).retrieve_data()
    parsed = Parser(raw_data).parse()
    parsed_united += parsed

postparsed = PostParser(parsed_united).postparse()
feature_extractor = FeactureExtractor(postparsed)
features = feature_extractor.extract()
```

> ensure all modules use appropriate configurations.

> ⚠️ When using the modules individually, without the assitance of the `Pipeline` class, the outputted configuration file will
> not have the raw data URL injected, which may compromise reproducibility. It is the user's responsibility to enable reproducing
> their results.
